WHAT IS DSA?
COLLECTION OF DIFFERENT ALGORITHMS FOR WHICH WE HAVE DIFFERENT TECHNIQUES 
WHAT IS ALGORITHM?
STEP-BY-STEP PROCESS TO SOLVE AN ALGORITHM 
THERE ARE TWO TYPES OF DATA STRUCTURES 1) STATIC AND DYNAMIC  2)LINEAR AND NON LINEAR \
EXAMPLES FOR 1): STACK , QUENE 
EXAMPLES FOR 2): TREES , GRAPHS 
IT DEPEND ON TWO POSSIBILTIES
1.TIME COMPLEXITY
2.SPACE COMPLEXITY
3 OPERATIONS ARE DONE ON ANY DATA STRUCTURES 
1) ADD OR PUSH 
2) DELETE OR COP
3) DISPLAY/SHOW OR PEAK
